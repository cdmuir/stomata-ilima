This study uses fossils from the major Southern Hemisphere family Proteaceae to test whether stomatal cell size responded to Cenozoic climate change. We measured the length and abundance of guard cells (the cells forming stomata), the area of epidermal pavement cells, stomatal index and maximum stomatal conductance from a comprehensive sample of fossil cuticles of Proteaceae, and extracted published estimates of past temperature and atmospheric CO 
              2 
              . We developed a novel test based on stochastic modelling of trait evolution to test correlations among traits. Guard cell length increased, and stomatal density decreased significantly with decreasing palaeotemperature. However, contrary to expectations, stomata tended to be smaller and more densely packed at higher atmospheric CO 
              2 
              . Thus, associations between stomatal traits and palaeoclimate over the last 70 million years in Proteaceae suggest that stomatal size is significantly affected by environmental factors other than atmospheric CO

              . Guard cell length, pavement cell area, stomatal density and stomatal index covaried in ways consistent with coordinated development of leaf tissues.},

	abstract = {SummaryPlant leaves provide the following main functions: (1) light interception and utilization of light energy for photosynthesis. This includes efficient light absorption under low and moderate light, while reducing excess light absorption under high light. (2) Incorporating CO2 as the substrate of photosynthesis, while limiting the amount of water lost. (3) Maintaining a stable internal environment for physiological processes by modulating leaf temperature. (4) Maintaining structural integrity that allows leaves to photosynthesize under various mechanical stresses such as gravity, wind, rainfall and herbivory. (5) Transporting water, photosynthates, and nutrients to realize efficient functioning of the plant and the leaf.Subjected to both anatomical and environmental constraints, natural selection has resulted in an intricate leaf anatomy that balances the above functions and allows plants to grow and produce progeny. As a result, plants coordinate size, number, shape, and arrangement of cells, adjust the thickness and chemical composition of cell walls, and utilize physical phenomena such as water evaporation, refraction, and reflection of light.In the present chapter, common features of leaf anatomy are described and the current knowledge related to its functions is summarized. Special emphasis will be given to leaf optical properties, gas diffusion, water transport, and mechanical properties. Acclimation and adaptation of leaf anatomy in response to environmental conditions will be reviewed. In addition, we will discuss the physiological mechanisms and ecological significance of these responses.},

The method requires at least ﬁve data pairs of net CO2 assimilation (A) and [CO2] in the intercellular airspaces of the leaf (Ci) and requires users to indicate the presumed limiting factor. The output is (1) calculated CO2 partial pressure at the sites of carboxylation, Cc, (2) values for the ﬁve parameters at the measurement temperature and (3) values adjusted to 25 °C to facilitate comparisons. Fitting this model is a way of exploring leaf level photosynthesis. However, interpreting leaf level photosynthesis in terms of underlying biochemistry and biophysics is subject to assumptions that hold to a greater or lesser degree, a major assumption being that all parts of the leaf are behaving in the same way at each instant.},

@article{warren_estimating_nodate,
	title = {Estimating the internal conductance to {CO2} movement},
	abstract = {The concentration of CO2 in the chloroplast is less than atmospheric owing to a series of gas-phase and liquid-phase resistances. For a long time it was assumed that the concentration of CO2 in the chloroplasts is the same as in the intercellular spaces (e.g. as measured by gas exchange). There is mounting evidence that this assumption is invalid and that CO2 concentrations in the chloroplasts are signiﬁcantly less than intercellular CO2. It is now generally accepted that internal conductance (gi) is a signiﬁcant limitation to photosynthesis, often as large as that due to stomata. Internal conductance describes this decrease in CO2 concentration between the intercellular spaces and chloroplasts as a function of net photosynthesis [gi = A / (Ci − Cc)]. Internal conductance is commonly estimated by simultaneous measurements of gas exchange and chlorophyll a ﬂuorescence or instantaneous discrimination against 13CO2. These common methods are complemented by three alternative methods based on (a) the difference between intercellular and chloroplastic CO2 photocompensation points, (b) the curvature of an A / Ci curve, and (c) the initial slope of an A / Ci curve v. the estimated initial slope of an A / Cc curve. The theoretical basis and protocols for estimating internal conductance are described. The common methods have poor precision with relative standard deviations commonly {\textgreater}10\%; much less is known of the precision of the three alternative methods. Accuracy of the methods is largely unknown because all methods share some common assumptions and no truly independent and assumption-free method exists. Some assumptions can and should be tested (e.g. the relationship of ﬂuorescence with electron transport). Methods generally require knowledge of either the kinetic parameters of Rubisco, or isotopic fractionation by Rubisco. These parameters are difﬁcult to measure, and thus are generally assumed a priori. For parameters such as these a sensitivity analysis is recommended. One means of improving conﬁdence in gi estimates is by using two or more methods, but it is essential that the methods chosen share as few common assumptions as possible. All methods require accurate and precise measurements of A and Ci — these are best achieved by minimising leaks, maximising the signal-to-noise ratio by using a large leaf area and moderate ﬂow rate, and by taking into account cuticular and boundary layer conductances.},

	abstract = {A realistic numerical three-dimensional (3D) model was constructed to study CO2 transport inside a birch leaf. The model included chloroplasts, palisade and spongy mesophyll cells, airspaces, stomatal opening and the leaf boundary layer. Diffusion equations for CO2 were solved for liquid(mesophyll) and gaseous(air) phases. Simulations were made in typical ambient ﬁeld conditions varying stomatal opening, photosynthetic capacity and temperature. Doubled ambient CO2 concentration was also considered. Changes in variables caused non-linear effects in the total ﬂux, especially when compared with the results of double CO2 concentration. The reduction in stomatal opening size had a smaller effect on the total ﬂux in doubled concentrations than ambient CO2. The reduced photosynthetic capacity had a similar effect on the ﬂux in both cases. The palisade and spongy mesophyll cells had unequal roles mainly due to the light absorption proﬁle. Results from the 3D simulation were also compared to the classical onedimensional resistance approach. Liquid and gas phase resistances were estimated and found strongly variable according to changes in temperature and degree of stomatal opening. For the birch leaves modelled, intercellular airspace resistance was small (2\% of the total resistance in saturating irradiance conditions at 25 ∞C at stomatal opening diameter of 4 mm) whereas the liquid phase resistance was signiﬁcant (23\% for mesophyll and chloroplasts in the same ‘base case’). The absorption of CO2 into water at cell surfaces caused additional (strongly temperature dependent) resistance which accounted for 36\% of the total resistance in the base case.},

Lack of evidence leads to circular-sounding reasoning: “this trait was shaped by selection in unseen ancestral populations and this selection must have occurred because the trait is present.” Well-supported adaptationist explanations include evidence that is not only abundant but selected from comparative, populational, and optimality perspectives, the three adaptationist subdisciplines. Each subdiscipline obtains its broad relevance in evolutionary biology via assumptions that can only be tested with the methods of the other subdisciplines. However, even in the best-supported explanations, assumptions regarding variation, heritability, and ﬁtness in unseen ancestral populations are always present. These assumptions are accepted given how well they would explain the data if they were true. This means that some degree of “circularity” is present in all evolutionary explanations. Evolutionary explanation corresponds not to a deductive structure, as biologists usually assert, but instead to ones such as abduction or Bayesianism. With these structures in mind, we show the way to a healthier view of “circularity” in evolutionary biology and why integration across the comparative, populational, and optimality approaches is necessary.},

Finite changes in A can thus be partitioned by integrating this sum across a ﬁnite interval. The most widely used method of estimating that integral is a coarse discrete approximation that uses partial derivatives of the natural logarithm of A rather than A itself. This yields biased and ambiguous estimates of partitioned changes in A. We present an alternative partitioning approach based on direct numerical integration of dA. The new approach does not require any partial derivatives to be computed, and it can be applied under any conditions to estimate the contributions from changes in any photosynthetic variable. We demonstrate this approach using ﬁeld measurements of both seasonal and diurnal changes in assimilation rate, and we provide a spreadsheet implementing the new approach.},

	abstract = {Maximum stomatal conductance to water vapour and CO2 (gwmax, gcmax, respectively), which are set at the time of leaf maturity, are determined predominantly by stomatal size (S) and density (D). In theory, many combinations of S and D yield the same gwmax and gcmax, so there is no inherent correlation between S and D, or between S, D and maximum stomatal conductance. However, using basic equations for gas diffusion through stomata of different sizes, we show that a negative correlation between S and D offers several advantages, including plasticity in gwmax and gcmax with minimal change in epidermal area allocation to stomata. Examination of the relationship between S and D in Eucalyptus globulus seedlings and coppice shoots growing in the ﬁeld under high and low rainfall revealed a strong negative relationship between S and D, whereby S decreased with increasing D according to a negative power function. The results provide evidence that plasticity in maximum stomatal conductance may be constrained by a negative S versus D relationship, with higher maximum stomatal conductance characterized by smaller S and higher D, and a tendency to minimize change in epidermal space allocation to stomata as S and D vary.},

	abstract = {CO2 faces a series of resistances while diffusing between the substomatal cavities and the sites of carboxylation within chloroplasts. The absence of techniques to measure the resistance of individual steps makes it difﬁcult to deﬁne their relative importance. Resistance to diffusion through intercellular airspace differs between leaves, but is usually of minor importance. Leaves with high photosynthetic capacity per unit leaf area reduce mesophyll resistance by increasing the surface area of chloroplasts exposed to intercellular airspace per unit leaf area, Sc. Cell walls impose a signiﬁcant resistance. Assuming an effective porosity of the cell wall of 0.1 or 0.05, then cell walls could account for 25\% or 50\% of the total mesophyll resistance, respectively. Since the fraction of apoplastic water that is unbound and available for unhindered CO2 diffusion is unknown, it is possible that the effective porosity is {\textless}0.05. Effective porosity could also vary in response to changes in pH or cation concentration. Consequently, cell walls could account for {\textgreater}50\% of the total resistance and a variable proportion. Most of the remaining resistance is imposed by one or more of the three membranes as mesophyll resistance can be altered by varying the expression of cooporins. The CO2 permeability of vesicles prepared from chloroplast envelopes has been reduced by RNA interference (RNAi) expression of NtAQP1, but not those prepared from the plasma membrane. Carbonic anhydrase activity also inﬂuences mesophyll resistance. Mesophyll resistance is relatively insensitive to the manipulation of any step in the pathway because it represents only part of the total and may also be countered by pleiotropic compensatory changes. The parameters in greatest need of additional measurements are Sc, mesophyll cell wall thickness, and the permeabilities of the plasma membrane and chloroplast envelope.},

Using a combination of several techniques, a comprehensive description of spinach leaves has been obtained. Proﬁles of CO2 ﬁxation were obtained by exposing leaves to 14CO2 for 10 s under blue or green light before freeze clamping and paradermal sectioning. Proﬁles of light absorption were measured on adjacent parts of the leaf by quantifying chlorophyll ﬂuorescence images of the transversely cut face obtained when blue or green light was applied to the adaxial or abaxial surface. The proﬁle of CO2 ﬁxation was modelled using the measured proﬁles of light absorption and photosynthetic capacity. There was remarkably good agreement between the observed and modelled CO2 ﬁxation proﬁles for the eight combinations of colour, orientation and irradiance tested. Gas exchange of an intact leaf was also measured concurrently with conventional chlorophyll ﬂuorescence under blue or green light. These data were consistent with the multi-layer leaf model with the exception of blue light applied to the abaxial surface, where chlorophyll ﬂuorescence appeared to come from layers deeper than expected. Photosynthetic capacity matched the proﬁle of green but not white light absorption through the leaf.},

	abstract = {Stomatal density tends to vary inversely with changes in atmospheric CO2 concentration (Ca). This phenomenon is of signiﬁcance due to: (i) the current anthropogenic rise in Ca and its impact on vegetation, and (ii) the potential applicability for reconstructing palaeoatmospheric Ca by using fossil plant remains. It is generally assumed that the inverse change of stomatal density with Ca represents an adaptation of epidermal gas conductance to varying Ca. Reconstruction of fossil Ca by using stomatal density is usually based on empirical curves which are obtained by greenhouse experiments or the study of herbarium material. In this contribution, a model describing the stomatal density response to changes in Ca is introduced. It is based on the diffusion of water vapour and CO2, photosynthesis and an optimisation principle concerning gas exchange and water availability. The model considers both aspects of stomatal conductance: degree of stomatal aperture and stomatal density. It is shown that stomatal aperture and stomatal density response can be separated with stomatal aperture representing a short-term response and stomatal density a long-term response. The model also demonstrates how the stomatal density response to Ca is modulated by environmental factors. This in turn implies that reliable reconstructions of ancient Ca require additional information concerning temperature and humidity of the considered sites. Finally, a sensitivity analysis was carried out for the relationship between stomatal density and Ca in order to identify critical parameters ( ¼ small parameter changes lead to signiﬁcant changes of the results). Stomatal pore geometry (pore size and depth) represents a critical parameter. In palaeoclimatic studies, pore geometry should therefore also be considered.},

	abstract = {Stomata are the major gates regulating substrate availability for photosynthesis and water loss. Although both processes are critical to yield and to resource-use efficiency, we lack a comprehensive picture on how domestication and further breeding have impacted on leaf stomata. To fill this gap, stomatal sizes and densities were screened in cultivated and wild ancestor representatives of a uniquely large group of 24 herbaceous crops. Anatomical data and gasexchange models were combined to compute maximum potential conductance to water, separately for upper and lower leaf sides. The evolution of maximum conductance under domestication was diverse. Several crops increased, others decreased (noticeably high-conductance species), and others kept a similar potential conductance following domestication. It was found that the contribution of upper leaf sides to maximum conductance was statistically higher in cultivated than in wild ancestors. For crops showing this response, reduced stomatal density in the lower side of domesticated leaves was responsible for the observed ‘adaxialization’ of conductance. Increases in the size of stomata at the upper epidermis played a comparatively minor role. Nevertheless, this overall response was varied in magnitude and direction, signalling crop-wise specificities. Observed patterns reflect only potential conductances based on anatomical traits and should be used with care until actual physiological outcomes are measured. Together with advancements in the developmental genetics of stomata, our findings might hint at new breeding avenues, focused on stomata distribution. Provided urgent needs for increasing yields, the opportunities of enhancing traits of the physiological relevance of stomata should not be ignored.},

	abstract = {Models of vegetation function are widely used to predict the effects of climate change on carbon, water and nutrient cycles of terrestrial ecosystems, and their feedbacks to climate. Stomatal conductance, the process that governs plant water use and carbon uptake, is fundamental to such models. In this paper, we reconcile two long-standing theories of stomatal conductance. The empirical approach, which is most commonly used in vegetation models, is phenomenological, based on experimental observations of stomatal behaviour in response to environmental conditions. The optimal approach is based on the theoretical argument that stomata should act to minimize the amount of water used per unit carbon gained. We reconcile these two approaches by showing that the theory of optimal stomatal conductance can be used to derive a model of stomatal conductance that is closely analogous to the empirical models. Consequently, we obtain a uniﬁed stomatal model which has a similar form to existing empirical models, but which now provides a theoretical interpretation for model parameter values. The key model parameter, g1, is predicted to increase with growth temperature and with the marginal water cost of carbon gain. The new model is ﬁtted to a range of datasets ranging from tropical to boreal trees. The parameter g1 is shown to vary with growth temperature, as predicted, and also with plant functional type. The model is shown to correctly capture responses of stomatal conductance to changing atmospheric CO2, and thus can be used to test for stomatal acclimation to elevated CO2. The reconciliation of the optimal and empirical approaches to modelling stomatal conductance is important for global change biology because it provides a simple theoretical framework for analyzing, and simulating, the coupling between carbon and water cycles under environmental change.},

	abstract = {Leaves within a canopy may experience rapid and extreme fluctuations in ambient conditions. A shaded leaf, for example, may become exposed to an order of magnitude increase in solar radiation within a few seconds, due to sunflecks or canopy motions. Considering typical time scales for stomatal adjustments, (2 to 60 minutes), the gap between these two time scales raised the question whether leaves rely on their hydraulic and thermal capacitances for passive protection from hydraulic failure or over-heating until stomata have adjusted. We employed a physically based model to systematically study effects of short-term fluctuations in irradiance on leaf temperatures and transpiration rates. Considering typical amplitudes and time scales of such fluctuations, the importance of leaf heat and water capacities for avoiding damaging leaf temperatures and hydraulic failure were investigated. The results suggest that common leaf heat capacities are not sufficient to protect a non-transpiring leaf from over-heating during sunflecks of several minutes duration whereas transpirative cooling provides effective protection. A comparison of the simulated time scales for heat damage in the absence of evaporative cooling with observed stomatal response times suggested that stomata must be already open before arrival of a sunfleck to avoid overheating to critical leaf temperatures. This is consistent with measured stomatal conductances in shaded leaves and has implications for water use efficiency of deep canopy leaves and vulnerability to heat damage during drought. Our results also suggest that typical leaf water contents could sustain several minutes of evaporative cooling during a sunfleck without increasing the xylem water supply and thus risking embolism. We thus submit that shaded leaves rely on hydraulic capacitance and evaporative cooling to avoid over-heating and hydraulic failure during exposure to typical sunflecks, whereas thermal capacitance provides limited protection for very short sunflecks (tens of seconds).},

We studied seven endemic Hawaiian Plantago taxa radiated across elevations, climates, and habitats. We grew plants of six taxa in controlled conditions for 1–2 yr and collected leaves from a seventh in the ﬁeld. For all taxa, we measured 46 leaf traits and tested hypotheses for trait-environment and trait-trait associations. Because of the rarity of the study plants, our study included low replication within taxa and multiple growth locations; despite these limitations, given reasonable assumptions, our analyses pointed to genetic differentiation among taxa. The leaves of bog taxa were smaller and thicker than those of woodland taxa, with higher leaf mass per area (LMA), stomatal pore area per leaf area, and carbon isotope discrimination (d13C). Taxa from higher elevations had thicker leaves and higher LMA, as well as lower nitrogen per mass and higher adaxial stomatal distribution. Taxa of drier sites had higher vein density and d13C. Many traits were allometrically related to leaf area, including stomatal density, major vein densities, and xylem conduit numbers and dimensions. Stomatal and xylem traits were correlated, indicating a matching of hydraulic supply and demand. Leaf diversiﬁcation in Hawaiian Plantago involved coordinated trait shifts, generating strong, apparently adaptive trait linkages.},

Tasmanian provenance seedlings began to produce juvenile leaves after 18 weeks, 4 weeks earlier than Wilsons Promontory seedlings. Tasmanian seedlings continued to produce juvenile foliage, whereas Wilsons Promontory seedlings began producing transitional leaves at 33 weeks. Successive transitional leaves ranged from the juvenile to the adult leaf form owing to variability in the rate of change of particular morphological and anatomical leaf characteristics. Retention of broad, thin, sessile, horizontally oriented, dorsiventral, hypostomatal juvenile leaves of Tasmanian seedlings assists in increasing growth rates under mesic conditions. Early production of thick, narrow, petiolate, vertically oriented, isobilateral, amphistomatal adult leaves by Wilsons Promontory seedlings appears to be related to the stressful conditions within its local habitat. An increase in amphistomy and the distribution of palisade mesophyll on both leaf surfaces with ontogenetic development was strongly related to leaf orientation and light interception, increasing the supply of CO2 for photosynthesis.},

The relative importance of different anatomical traits in constraining CO2 diffusion was evaluated using a quantitative model. Mesophyll conductance (gm) was most strongly correlated with chloroplast exposed surface to leaf area ratio (Sc/S) and cell wall thickness (Tcw), but, depending on foliage structure, the overall importance of gm in constraining photosynthesis and the importance of different anatomical traits in the restriction of CO2 diffusion varied. In species with mesophytic leaves, membrane permeabilities and cytosol and stromal conductance dominated the variation in gm. However, in species with sclerophytic leaves, gm was mostly limited by Tcw. These results demonstrate the major role of anatomy in constraining mesophyll diffusion conductance and, consequently, in determining the variability in photosynthetic capacity among species.},

	abstract = {Stomata are essential for diffusive entry of gases to support photosynthesis, but may also expose internal leaf tissues to pathogens. To uncover trade-offs in range-wide adaptation relating to stomata, we investigated the underlying genetics of stomatal traits and linked variability in these traits with geoclimate, ecophysiology, condensed foliar tannins and pathogen susceptibility in black cottonwood (Populus trichocarpa). Upper (adaxial) and lower (abaxial) leaf stomatal traits were measured from 454 accessions collected throughout much of the species range. We calculated broad-sense heritability (H2) of stomatal traits and, using SNP data from a 34K Populus SNP array, performed a genome-wide association studies (GWAS) to uncover genes underlying stomatal trait variation. H2 values for stomatal traits were moderate (average H2 = 0.33). GWAS identiﬁed genes associated primarily with adaxial stomata, including polarity genes (PHABULOSA), stomatal development genes (BRASSINOSTEROID-INSENSITIVE 2) and disease/wound-response genes (GLUTAMATE-CYSTEINE LIGASE). Stomatal traits correlated with latitude, gas exchange, condensed tannins and leaf rust (Melampsora) infection. Latitudinal trends of greater adaxial stomata numbers and guard cell pore size corresponded with higher stomatal conductance (gs) and photosynthesis (Amax), faster shoot elongation, lower foliar tannins and greater Melampsora susceptibility. This suggests an evolutionary trade-off related to differing selection pressures across the species range. In northern environments, more adaxial stomata and larger pore sizes reﬂect selection for rapid carbon gain and growth. By contrast, southern genotypes have fewer adaxial stomata, smaller pore sizes and higher levels of condensed tannins, possibly linked to greater pressure from natural leaf pathogens, which are less signiﬁcant in northern ecosystems.},

	abstract = {The capacity of plants to ﬁx carbon is ultimately constrained by two core plant attributes: photosynthetic biochemistry and the conductance to CO2 diffusion from the atmosphere to sites of carboxylation in chloroplasts, predominantly stomatal conductance. Analysis of fossilized plant remains shows that stomatal density (number per unit area, D) and size (length by width, S) have ﬂuctuated widely over the Phanerozoic Eon, indicating changes in maximum stomatal conductance. Parallel changes are likely to have taken place in leaf photosynthetic biochemistry, of which maximal rubisco carboxylation rate, Vcmax is a central element. We used measurements of S and D from fossilized plant remains spanning the last 400 Myr (most of the Phanerozoic), together with leaf gas exchange data and modeled Phanerozoic trends in atmospheric CO2 concentration, [CO2]a, to calibrate a [CO2]a-driven model of the long-term environmental inﬂuences on S, D and Vcmax. We show that over the Phanerozoic large changes in [CO2]a forced S, D and Vcmax to co-vary so as to reduce the impact of the change in [CO2]a on leaf CO2 assimilation for minimal energetic cost and reduced nitrogen requirements. Underlying this is a general negative correlation between S and D, and a positive correlation between water-use efﬁciency and [CO2]a. Furthermore, the calculated steady rise in stomatal conductance over the Phanerozoic is consistent with independent evidence for the evolution of plant hydraulic capacity, implying coordinated and sustained increase in gas exchange capacity and hydraulic capacity parallel long-term increases in land plant diversity.},

	abstract = {Natural selection on photosynthetic performance is a primary factor determining leaf phenotypes. The complex CO2 diffusion path from substomatal cavities to the chloroplasts – the mesophyll conductance (gm) – limits photosynthetic rate in many species and hence shapes variation in leaf morphology and anatomy. Among sclerophyllous and succulent taxa, structural investment in leaves, measured as the leaf dry mass per area (LMA), has been implicated in decreased gm. However, in herbaceous taxa with high gm, it is less certain how LMA impacts CO2 diffusion and whether it signiﬁcantly affects photosynthetic performance. We addressed these questions in the context of understanding the ecophysiological signiﬁcance of leaf trait variation in wild tomatoes, a closely related group of herbaceous perennials. Although gm was high in wild tomatoes, variation in gm signiﬁcantly affected photosynthesis. Even in these tenderleaved herbaceous species, greater LMA led to reduced gm. This relationship between gm and LMA is partially mediated by cell packing and leaf thickness, although amphistomy (equal distribution of stomata on both sides of the leaf) mitigates the effect of leaf thickness. Understanding the costs of increased LMA will inform future work on the adaptive signiﬁcance of leaf trait variation across ecological gradients in wild tomatoes and other systems.},

	abstract = {Ecologically important traits do not evolve without limits. Instead, evolution is constrained by the set of available and viable phenotypes. In particular, natural selection may only favour a narrow range of adaptive optima constrained within selective regimes. Here, I integrate data with theory to test whether selection explains phenotypic constraint. A global database of 599 plant species from 94 families shows that stomatal ratio, a trait affecting photosynthesis and defence against pathogens, is highly constrained. Most plants have their stomata on the lower leaf surface (hypostomy), but species with half their stomata on each surface (amphistomy) form a distinct mode in the trait distribution. A model based on a trade-off between maximizing photosynthesis and a fitness cost of upper stomata predicts a limited number of adaptive solutions, leading to a multimodal trait distribution. Phylogenetic comparisons show that amphistomy is the most common among fast-growing species, supporting the view that CO 
              2 
              diffusion is under strong selection. These results indicate that selective optima stay within a relatively stable set of selective regimes over macroevolutionary time.},

	abstract = {Though numerous investigators have recorded observations on the number of stomata present in various species, comparatively little is known respecting the causes of their numerical variation. Studies on the “sun” and “shade” leaves of woodland plants brought to light the striking differences which the numerical frequency of stomata may exhibit in leaves of the same species when growing in different environments and even in different leaves of the same individual. Various hypotheses have been put forward to explain the larger number of stomata in sun-leaves. These will be considered later, but we may note here the apparent discrepancy with the observations of Ziegeler that the leaves of the more xerophytic Carices possess fewer stomata than the leaves of those species characteristic of damper habitats. Spitzer obtained similar results from an examination of the Grasses and Adamson appears to have arrived at a similar conclusion with regard to the various species of

              diffusion inside the leaf was probably critical in elevating rates of photosynthesis that occurred among angiosperm lineages. Here we characterize the three-dimensional surface area of the leaf mesophyll across vascular plants. We show that genome size determines the sizes and packing densities of cells in all leaf tissues and that smaller cells enable more mesophyll surface area to be packed into the leaf volume, facilitating higher CO

              diffusion. Measurements and modelling revealed that the spongy mesophyll layer better facilitates gaseous phase diffusion while the palisade mesophyll layer better facilitates liquid-phase diffusion. Our results demonstrate that genome downsizing among the angiosperms was critical to restructuring the entire pathway of CO

            Lateral diffusion of CO2 was investigated in photosynthesizing leaves with different anatomy by gas exchange and chlorophyll a fluorescence imaging using grease to block stomata. When one-half of the leaf surface of the heterobaric species Helianthus annuus was covered by 4-mm-diameter patches of grease, the response of net CO2 assimilation rate (A) to intercellular CO2 concentration (Ci) indicated that higher ambient CO2 concentrations (Ca) caused only limited lateral diffusion into the greased areas. When single 4-mm patches were applied to leaves of heterobaric Phaseolus vulgaris and homobaric Commelina communis, chlorophyll a fluorescence images showed dramatic declines in the quantum efficiency of photosystem II electron transport (measured as Fq′/Fm′) across the patch, demonstrating that lateral CO2 diffusion could not support A. The Fq′/Fm′ values were used to compute images of Ci across patches, and their dependence on Ca was assessed. At high Ca, the patch effect was less in C. communis than P. vulgaris. A finite-volume porous-medium model for assimilation rate and lateral CO2 diffusion was developed to analyze the patch images. The model estimated that the effective lateral CO2 diffusion coefficients inside C. communis and P. vulgaris leaves were 22\% and 12\% of that for free air, respectively. We conclude that, in the light, lateral CO2 diffusion cannot support appreciable photosynthesis over distances of more than approximately 0.3 mm in normal leaves, irrespective of the presence or absence of bundle sheath extensions, because of the CO2 assimilation by cells along the diffusion pathway.},

	abstract = {Abstract
            Plant ecophysiology is founded on a rich body of physical and chemical theory, but it is challenging to connect theory with data in unambiguous, analytically rigorous and reproducible ways. Custom scripts written in computer programming languages (coding) enable plant ecophysiologists to model plant processes and fit models to data reproducibly using advanced statistical techniques. Since many ecophysiologists lack formal programming education, we have yet to adopt a unified set of coding principles and standards that could make coding easier to learn, use and modify. We identify eight principles to help in plant ecophysiologists without much programming experience to write resilient code: (i) standardized nomenclature, (ii) consistency in style, (iii) increased modularity/extensibility for easier editing and understanding, (iv) code scalability for application to large data sets, (v) documented contingencies for code maintenance, (vi) documentation to facilitate user understanding; (vii) extensive tutorials and (viii) unit testing and benchmarking. We illustrate these principles using a new R package, \{photosynthesis\}, which provides a set of analytical and simulation tools for plant ecophysiology. Our goal with these principles is to advance scientific discovery in plant ecophysiology by making it easier to use code for simulation and data analysis, reproduce results and rapidly incorporate new biological understanding and analytical tools.},

The allocation pattern is calculated under the assumption that nitrogen distribution is optimised in order to maximise daily whole-plant assimilation. The solution is fairly sensitive to the assimilation function applied. It is shown that assimilation functions homogeneous in irradiance and nitrogen imply assimilation gradients and light-saturation characteristics of the whole canopy which contradict experimental findings. An equation for the calculation of electron transport rates as a function of the intra-leaf gradient of the photosynthetic photon flux density is presented. This inhomogeneous assimilation function leads to substantially different predictions of nitrogen allocation which reproduce a wider array of observed allocation patterns. The results presented in this paper support the thesis that the intra-leaf gradient of photosynthetic photon flux density and self-shading of the thylakoids need to be considered if the assimilation flux is to be modelled as a function of light as well as nitrogen availability on a mechanistic basis.},

              3
              photosynthesis is highly conserved across plants, substantial leaf structural and enzymatic variation translates into variability in rates of carbon assimilation. Although this variation is well documented, it remains poorly understood how photosynthetic rates evolve, and whether macroevolutionary changes are related to the evolution of leaf morphology and biochemistry. A substantial challenge in large-scale comparative studies is disentangling evolutionary adaptation from environmental acclimation. We overcome this by using a ‘macroevolutionary common garden’ approach in which we measured metabolic traits (
              J
              max
              and
              V
              cmax
              ) from 111 phylogenetically diverse species in a shared environment. We find substantial phylogenetic signal in these traits at moderate phylogenetic timescales, but this signal dissipates quickly at deeper scales. Morphological traits exhibit phylogenetic signal over much deeper timescales, suggesting that these are less evolutionarily constrained than metabolic traits. Furthermore, while morphological and biochemical traits (LMA,
              N
              area
              and
              C

              ) are weakly predictive of
              J

              and

                c
              
              max
              , evolutionary changes in these traits are mostly decoupled from changes in metabolic traits. This lack of tight evolutionary coupling implies that it may be incorrect to use changes in these functional traits in response to global change to infer that photosynthetic strategy is also evolving.},

	abstract = {Life on Earth comes in many forms, but all life-forms share a common element in carbon. It is the basic building block of biology, and by trapping radiation it also plays an important role in maintaining the Earth's atmosphere at a temperature hospitable to life. Like all matter, carbon can neither be created nor destroyed, but instead is continuously exchanged between ecosystems and the environment through a complex combination of physics and biology. In recent decades, these exchanges have led to an increased accumulation of carbon on the land surface: the terrestrial carbon sink. Over the past 10 years (2007–2016) the sink has removed an estimated 3.61 Pg C year
              −1
              from the atmosphere, which amounts to 33.7\% of total anthropogenic emissions from industrial activity and land-use change. This sink constitutes a valuable ecosystem service, which has significantly slowed the rate of climate change. Here, we review current understanding of the underlying biological processes that govern the terrestrial carbon sink and their dependence on climate, atmospheric composition, and human interventions.},

	abstract = {Attempts to correlate values of stomatal conductance and leaf water potential with particular environmental variables in the field are generally of only limited success because they are simultaneously affected by a number of environmental variables. For example, correlations between leaf water potential and either flux of radiant energy or vapour pressure deficit show a diurnal hysteresis which leads to a scatter diagram if many values are plotted. However, a simple model may be adequate to relate leaf water potential to the flow of water through the plant. The stomatal conductance of illuminated leaves is a function of current levels of temperature, vapour pressure deficit, leaf water potential (really turgor pressure) and ambient CO
              2
              concentration. Consequently, when plotted against any one of these variables a scatter diagram results. Physiological knowledge of stomatal functioning is not adequate to provide a mechanistic model linking stomatal conductance to all these variables. None the less, the parameters describing the relationships with the variables can be conveniently estimated from field data by a technique of non-linear least squares, for predictive purposes and to describe variations in response from season to season and plant to plant.},

The presence of stomata on both leaf surfaces, termed amphistomy, increases photosynthetic rate, is common in plants from high light habitats, and rare otherwise. In this study I use optimality models based on leaf energy budget and photosynthetic models to ask why amphistomy is common in high light habitats. I developed an R package leafoptimizer to solve for stomatal traits that optimally balance carbon gain with water loss in a given environment. The model predicts that amphistomy is common in high light because its marginal effect on carbon gain is greater than in the shade, but only if the costs of amphistomy are also lower under high light than in the shade. More generally, covariation between costs and benefits may explain why stomatal and other traits form discrete phenotypic clusters.},

Isotopic discrimination measured over the short term correlated strongly with that determined from combusted leaf material. Environmental conditions were manipulated to alter the relative influences of stomatal conductance and carboxylation on the discrimination of carbon isotopes by intact leaves. With C3 plants, discrimination increased as the gradient in partial pressure of CO2 across the stomata decreased. For C4 plants there was little change in discrimination despite substantial changes in the diffusion gradient across the sto- mata. These results are consistent with, and provide the first direct experimental support for, theoretical equations describing discrimination during photosynthesis. 
    Despite uncertainties about various processes affecting carbon isotope composition, the resistance to the transfer of CO2 from the intercellular airspaces to the sites of carboxylation in the mesophyll chloroplasts was estimated using this technique.

            The hydraulic implications of stomatal positioning across leaf surfaces and the impact on internal water flow through amphistomatic leaves are not currently well understood. Amphistomaty potentially provides hydraulic efficiencies if the majority of hydraulic resistance in the leaf exists outside the xylem in the mesophyll. Such a scenario would mean that the same xylem network could equally supply a hypostomatic or amphistomatic leaf. Here we examine leaves of Helianthus annuus to determine whether amphistomaty in this species is associated with higher hydraulic efficiency compared with hypostomatic leaves. We identified asymmetry in the positioning of minor veins which were significantly closer to the abaxial than the adaxial leaf surface, combined with lower Kleaf when transpiration was driven through the adaxial rather than the abaxial surface. We also identified a degree of coordination in stomatal behaviour driven by leaf hydraulics, where the hydraulic conditions experienced by an individual leaf surface affected the stomatal behaviour on the opposite surface. We found no advantage to amphistomaty based on efficiencies in construction costs of the venous system, represented by vein density:stomatal density, only limited hydraulic independence between leaf surfaces. These results suggest that amphistomaty does not substantially increase whole-leaf hydraulic efficiency.},

            Guard cell turgor pressures in epidermal peels of broad bean (Vicia faba) were measured and controlled with a pressure probe. At the same time, images of the guard cell were acquired using confocal microscopy. To obtain a clear image of guard cell volume, a fluorescent dye that labels the plasma membrane was added to the solution bathing the epidermal peel. At each pressure, 17 to 20 optical sections (each 2 μm thick) were acquired. Out-of-focus light in these images was removed using blind deconvolution, and volume was estimated using direct linear integration. As pressure was increased from as low as 0.3 MPa to as high as 5.0 MPa, guard cell volume increased in a saturating fashion. The elastic modulus was calculated from these data and was found to range from approximately 2 to 40 MPa. The data allow inference of guard cell osmotic content from stomatal aperture and facilitate accurate mechanistic modeling of epidermal water relations and stomatal functioning.},

Nevertheless, little is known about the physical principles that constrain vascular architecture. Inspired by plant leaves, we used microfluidic devices consisting of simple parallel channel networks in a polymeric material layer, permeable to water, to study the mechanisms of and the limits to evaporation-driven flow. We show that the flow rate through our biomimetic leaves increases linearly with channel density (1/
              d
              ) until the distance between channels (
              d
              ) is comparable with the thickness of the polymer layer (δ), above which the flow rate saturates. A comparison with the plant vascular networks shows that the same optimization criterion can be used to describe the placement of veins in leaves. These scaling relations for evaporatively driven flow through simple networks reveal basic design principles for the engineering of evaporation–permeation-driven devices, and highlight the role of physical constraints on the biological design of leaves.},

            Phylogenetic comparative methods have long been a mainstay of evolutionary biology, allowing for inferences of the tempo and mode of trait evolution across species while accounting for their common ancestry. These analyses typically assume a single, bifurcating phylogenetic tree that describes the shared history among species. However, modern phylogenomic analyses have shown that genomes are often composed of a mosaic of different histories that can disagree both with the species tree and with each other—so-called discordant gene trees. These gene trees describe shared histories that are not captured by the species tree, and therefore that are unaccounted for in classic comparative approaches. The application of standard phylogenetic comparative methods to species histories containing discordance leads to incorrect inferences about the timing, direction, and rate of evolution. Here, we develop two approaches for incorporating gene tree histories into comparative methods: one involves constructing a fuller phylogenetic variance-covariance matrix that includes relationships not found in the species tree, and another that applies Felsenstein’s pruning algorithm over a set of gene trees to calculate trait histories and likelihoods. Both approaches are agnostic to the biological causes of gene tree discordance, which may include incomplete lineage sorting and introgression. Using simulation, we demonstrate that our new approaches generate much more accurate estimates of tree-wide rates of trait evolution than standard methods. We apply our methods to two clades of the wild tomato genus
            Solanum
            with varying rates of discordance, demonstrating the contribution of gene tree discordance to variation in a set of floral traits and the ability of our approaches to provide more accurate inferences. Our new approaches have the potential to be applied to a broad range of classic inference problems in phylogenetics, including ancestral state reconstruction and the inference of lineage-specific rate shifts.},

            Sorghum (Sorghum bicolor) is a model C4 crop made experimentally tractable by extensive genomic and genetic resources. Biomass sorghum is studied as a feedstock for biofuel and forage. Mechanistic modeling suggests that reducing stomatal conductance (gs) could improve sorghum intrinsic water use efficiency (iWUE) and biomass production. Phenotyping to discover genotype-to-phenotype associations remains a bottleneck in understanding the mechanistic basis for natural variation in gs and iWUE. This study addressed multiple methodological limitations. Optical tomography and a machine learning tool were combined to measure stomatal density (SD). This was combined with rapid measurements of leaf photosynthetic gas exchange and specific leaf area (SLA). These traits were the subject of genome-wide association study and transcriptome-wide association study across 869 field-grown biomass sorghum accessions. The ratio of intracellular to ambient CO2 was genetically correlated with SD, SLA, gs, and biomass production. Plasticity in SD and SLA was interrelated with each other and with productivity across wet and dry growing seasons. Moderate-to-high heritability of traits studied across the large mapping population validated associations between DNA sequence variation or RNA transcript abundance and trait variation. A total of 394 unique genes underpinning variation in WUE-related traits are described with higher confidence because they were identified in multiple independent tests. This list was enriched in genes whose Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) putative orthologs have functions related to stomatal or leaf development and leaf gas exchange, as well as genes with nonsynonymous/missense variants. These advances in methodology and knowledge will facilitate improving C4 crop WUE.},

              Background
              Recent reports of extreme levels of undersaturation in internal leaf air spaces have called into question one of the foundational assumptions of leaf gas exchange analysis, that leaf air spaces are effectively saturated with water vapour at leaf surface temperature. Historically, inferring the biophysical states controlling assimilation and transpiration from the fluxes directly measured by gas exchange systems has presented a number of challenges, including: (1) a mismatch in scales between the area of flux measurement, the biochemical cellular scale and the meso-scale introduced by the localization of the fluxes to stomatal pores; (2) the inaccessibility of the internal states of CO2 and water vapour required to define conductances; and (3) uncertainties about the pathways these internal fluxes travel. In response, plant physiologists have adopted a set of simplifying assumptions that define phenomenological concepts such as stomatal and mesophyll conductances.
            
            
              Scope
              Investigators have long been concerned that a failure of basic assumptions could be distorting our understanding of these phenomenological conductances, and the biophysical states inside leaves. Here we review these assumptions and historical efforts to test them. We then explore whether artefacts in analysis arising from the averaging of fluxes over macroscopic leaf areas could provide alternative explanations for some part, if not all, of reported extreme states of undersaturation.
            
            
              Conclusions
              Spatial heterogeneities can, in some cases, create the appearance of undersaturation in the internal air spaces of leaves. Further refinement of experimental approaches will be required to separate undersaturation from the effects of spatial variations in fluxes or conductances. Novel combinations of current and emerging technologies hold promise for meeting this challenge.},

            The formation of stomata and leaf mesophyll airspace must be coordinated to establish an efficient and robust network that facilitates gas exchange for photosynthesis, however the mechanism by which this coordinated development occurs remains unclear. Here, we combine microCT and gas exchange analyses with measures of stomatal size and patterning in a range of wild, domesticated and transgenic lines of wheat and Arabidopsis to show that mesophyll airspace formation is linked to stomatal function in both monocots and eudicots. Our results support the hypothesis that gas flux via stomatal pores influences the degree and spatial patterning of mesophyll airspace formation, and indicate that this relationship has been selected for during the evolution of modern wheat. We propose that the coordination of stomata and mesophyll airspace pattern underpins water use efficiency in crops, providing a target for future improvement.},

	abstract = {X-ray micro-computed tomography (X-ray microCT) has enabled the characterization of the properties and processes that take place in plants and soils at the micron scale. Despite the widespread use of this advanced technique, major limitations in both hardware and software limit the speed and accuracy of image processing and data analysis. Recent advances in machine learning, specifically the application of convolutional neural networks to image analysis, have enabled rapid and accurate segmentation of image data. Yet, challenges remain in applying convolutional neural networks to the analysis of environmentally and agriculturally relevant images. Specifically, there is a disconnect between the computer scientists and engineers, who build these AI/ML tools, and the potential end users in agricultural research, who may be unsure of how to apply these tools in their work. Additionally, the computing resources required for training and applying deep learning models are unique, more common to computer gaming systems or graphics design work, than to traditional computational systems. To navigate these challenges, we developed a modular workflow for applying convolutional neural networks to X-ray microCT images, using low-cost resources in Googles Colaboratory web application. Here we present the results of the workflow, illustrating how parameters can be optimized to achieve best results using example scans from walnut leaves, almond flower buds, and a soil aggregate. We expect that this framework will accelerate the adoption and use of emerging deep learning techniques within the plant and soil sciences.},

            When microscopy meets modelling the exciting concept of a ‘virtual leaf’ is born. The goal of a ‘virtual leaf’ is to capture complex physiology in a virtual environment, resulting in the capacity to run experiments computationally. One example of a ‘virtual leaf’ application is capturing 3D anatomy from volume microscopy data and estimating where water evaporates in the leaf and the proportions of apoplastic, symplastic and gas phase water transport. The same 3D anatomy could then be used to improve established 3D reaction-diffusion models, providing a better understanding of the transport of CO2 across the stomata, through the airspace and across the mesophyll cell wall. This viewpoint discusses recent progress that has been made in transitioning from a bulk leaf approach to a 3D understanding of leaf physiology, in particular, the movement of CO2 and H2O within the leaf.},

Stomata can influence leaf function, with changes in density and size affecting potential water loss, CO2 uptake, and also leaf cooling. Plasticity in stomatal traits occurs in response to environmental factors; however, identifying which factors have the greatest influence is often difficult. We investigated variation in leaf size, stomatal density and size, and potential water loss from open stomata (gwmax), in the Australian native shrub Dodonaea viscosa subsp. angustissima, across a range of environmental factors including temperature, rainfall and CO2. We used herbarium specimens collected across a latitudinal gradient, and also sampled along an elevation gradient in southern Australia. There were significant relationships between mean summer maximum temperature and stomatal density, and gwmax. We found no significant relationships between rainfall or CO2 and the leaf traits we studied. Increased stomatal density at warmer locations may result in an increase in the potential for transpiration, as a means for evaporative cooling. Alternatively, it may enable increased CO2 and nutrient uptake during the short, winter-growing season.},

	abstract = {The endemic Hawaiian lobeliads are exceptionally species rich and exhibit striking diversity in habitat, growth form, pollination biology and seed dispersal, but their origins and pattern of diversification remain shrouded in mystery. Up to five independent colonizations have been proposed based on morphological differences among extant taxa. We present a molecular phylogeny showing that the Hawaiian lobeliads are the product of one immigration event; that they are the largest plant clade on any single oceanic island or archipelago; that their ancestor arrived roughly 13 Myr ago; and that this ancestor was most likely woody, wind-dispersed, bird-pollinated, and adapted to open habitats at mid-elevations. Invasion of closed tropical forests is associated with evolution of fleshy fruits. Limited dispersal of such fruits in wet-forest understoreys appears to have accelerated speciation and led to a series of parallel adaptive radiations in
              Cyanea
              , with most species restricted to single islands. Consistency of
              Cyanea
              diversity across all tall islands except Hawai i suggests that diversification of
              Cyanea
              saturates in less than 1.5 Myr. Lobeliad diversity appears to reflect a hierarchical adaptive radiation in habitat, then elevation and flower-tube length, and provides important insights into the pattern and tempo of diversification in a species-rich clade of tropical plants.},

                    cw

                    as a separate parameter in most common gas exchange measurements. Here, we describe a simple technique to simultaneously estimate adaxial and abaxial values of

            The key role of cell walls in setting mesophyll conductance to CO2 (gm) and, consequently, photosynthesis is reviewed. First, the theoretical properties of cell walls that can affect gm are presented. Then, we focus on cell wall thickness (Tcw) reviewing empirical evidence showing that Tcw varies strongly among species and phylogenetic groups in a way that correlates with gm and photosynthesis; that is, the thicker the mesophyll cell walls, the lower the gm and photosynthesis. Potential interplays of gm, Tcw, dehydration tolerance, and hydraulic properties of leaves are also discussed. Dynamic variations of Tcw in response to the environment and their implications in the regulation of photosynthesis are discussed, and recent evidence suggesting an influence of cell wall composition on gm is presented. We then propose a hypothetical mechanism for the influence of cell walls on photosynthesis, combining the effects of thickness and composition, particularly pectins. Finally, we discuss the prospects for using biotechnology for enhancing photosynthesis by altering cell wall-related genes.},
